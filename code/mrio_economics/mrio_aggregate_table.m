function [aggregated_mriot, climada_mriot]=mrio_aggregate_table(climada_mriot, ROW_flag, full_aggregation_flag)
% mrio aggregate table
% MODULE:
%   climada_advanced
% NAME:
%   mrio_aggregate_table
% PURPOSE:
%   Transforms a full climada mrio table struct (usually "climada_mriot") into an aggregated  
%   table that consists only of the six climada sectors. It does retain the original
%   number of countries, however.
%   
%   previous call: mrio_read_table 
%
%   next call: (function to calculate country- and sector-specific DIRECT tropical
%       cylone risk associated with the six climada sectors as represented
%       in the aggregated mriot.)
%
% CALLING SEQUENCE:
%   mrio_read_table;
%   mrio_aggregate_table;
%  
% EXAMPLE:
%   aggregated_mriot = mrio_aggregate_table(climada_mriot); RECOMMENDED. Already existing climada_mriot struct provided as argument, 
%                                                           only aggregeated table returned.
%   [aggregated_mriot, climada_mriot]= mrio_aggregate_table; no arguments provided. User is prompted whether a
%       required climada_mriot struct should be created. The latter is
%       returned as the second output.
%   aggregated_mriot = mrio_aggregate_table; NOT RECOMMENDED. As above, but
%       the created climada_mriot struct is not returned (only the
%       aggregated version).
%
%
% INPUTS:
%
% OPTIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS:
%   climada_mriot: a climada_mriot structure containing a full mriot as
%       imported with the function climada_read_mriot. If not provided, user is
%       prompted whether the climada_read_mriot function should be called prior to 
%       continuing with current function or whether current function should be aborted.
%  ROW_flag: integer flag; if 1 stating that the aggregation should also include the
%       aggregation of several ROW regions present in some MRIOTs (e.g.
%       exiobase) into just one ROW region which facilitates calculations further
%       down the line. Default is 0, i.e. aggregation follows the
%       original ROW subdivision into several ROW regions, if applicable.
%       Cautionary note: doing this aggregation has implications for the
%       disaggregation computation too!
%  full_aggregation_flag: flag sepcifying whether a full aggregation shall
%      be computed (=1; i.e. we aggregated all mrio sector-sector data) or a
%      "minimal" aggregation (=0, default), where the mrio data itself is not
%      aggregated and only the country and sector labels corresponding to the
%      mainsectors as well as info on which subsectors belong to which
%      mainsector are computed.
%  
% OUTPUTS:
%   aggregated_mriot: 
%       a structure with eleven fields. It represents an 
%       aggregated version of the general climada mriot structure. Aggregated
%       here means that all subsectors as represented in the full mriot are
%       taken together so that only the six climada sectors are represented in
%       the table: agriculture, forestry_fishing, mining_quarrying, manufacturing,
%       utilities supply and services. A field retains the information on which subsectors
%       have been aggregated into each climada sector. 
%       No aggregation is done on the countries.
%       For comparability, the resulting structure retains an 
%       analogous - well - structure,  to the full table. 
%   The fields are:
%       countries: a categorical array containing the full list of all
%           countries in the order they appear in the
%           industry-by-industry mriot. 
%           List of countries is repeated m number of times with m =
%           no. of sectors, i.e. here m = 6.
%       countries_iso: 3-digit iso code of each country. As above.
%       sectors: as above for countries, but for all six climada sectors. 
%           List of sectors will be repeated n number of times with n =
%           no. of countries.
%       aggregation_info: itself a struct with six fields, containing for each 
%           climada sector the list of subsectors that constitute it. Each
%           field stands for one cliamda sectors (hence, six fields). The
%           entries in each field will depend on the original mriot type
%           the climada_mriot is based on (exiobase, wiod, etc.).
%       mrio_data: sector-by-sector numerical data matrix (quadratic). 
%           The actual aggregated mriot, without any labels. To get a commodity
%           exchange value of interest, index into here with the
%           corresponding row- and column indices as extracted from the full countries and/or
%           sectors arrays. If it was chosen to only compute a minimal
%           aggregation, this field contains a character array specifying
%           this.
%       table_type: character array simply stating the table type the mriot
%           struct is originally based on. Is unchanged from the
%           climada_mriot struct.
%       filename: character array specifying the full path to the mriot
%           file originally passed as argument to climada_read_mriot to construct 
%           climada mriot structure. Is unchanged from the
%           climada_mriot struct.
%       no_of_countries: integer value stating the number of countries that
%           is contained in the mriot struct (i.e. in the table type the
%           struct is based on). Different for different table types and
%           might change with future releases. Is unchanged from the
%           climada_mriot struct.
%       no_of_sectors: as above but for number of sectors. Here always 6,
%           unless basic climada sectors are extended in future. 
%       aggregated_ROW: logical. True if the povided mriot has several ROW
%           regions that have been aggregated in this function. Unless ROW_flag is
%           provided, is always false. If original mriot has only one ROW
%           it will always be false (no aggregation possible).
%
%       unit: unit used in the original mriot. Same as in full climada_mriot.
%       
%       
%   climada_mriot: optinally and only if user did not provide a
%       climada_mriot structure as input which was then created within
%       function. A structure as it is created by mrio_read_table.
%
% GENERAL NOTES:
%
% NO IN-DEPTH TESTING OF RESULTS CONDUCTED YET!
%
% In next step, consider extending mrio_read_table with a flag which
% directly calls mrio_aggregate_table from within the prior function,
% returning both the full and the aggregated table directly (could lead to
% some function workspace memory issues)...
%
% MODIFICATION HISTORY:
% Kaspar Tobler, 20171220 initializing function
% Kaspar Tobler, 20180104 finishing raw prototype version. Basic capabilities are provided and work.
% Kaspar Tobler, 20180112 add climada_mriot as optional output if no such structure is provided as input and it thus created within function using mrio_read_table.
% Kaspar Tobler, 20180118 added an additional field of climada_sect_id analogous to the field in the climada_mriot struct.
% Kaspar Tobler, 20180125-26 provided functionality to deal with mriots which subdivide ROW into several ROW regions (e.g. exiobase): if asked for, aggregation now also aggregated these several ROW regions into just one ROW.
% Kaspar Tobler, 20180129 added functionality that no full aggregation of the mrio data itself is computed if requested (via input argument). 
%       This is due to fact that for "standard" procedure as laid out in mrio_master this is not needed. In a "minimal" aggregation, only the country and sector labels etc. are adjusted to an aggregated table.
