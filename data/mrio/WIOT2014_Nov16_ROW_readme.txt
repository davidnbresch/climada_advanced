____________________________________________

The method combines the core climada functionality with multi-regional input-output (MRIO) economics. It is primarily based on output of MRIO models. We have made an effort to be compatible with major MRIO tables that are freely available. For more details on the Input-Output models and supported tables, please see the climada advanced manual or the Master thesis (see below).
